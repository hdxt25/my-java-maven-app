## Build Instructions

To build the project, ensure you have Maven installed on your machine. You can then run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
mvn clean package
```

This command will execute the following stages:

1. **Compile**: Compiles the source code.
2. **Review**: Runs any code analysis tools (if configured).
3. **Test**: Executes the unit tests defined in the `src/test` directory.
4. **Package**: Packages the compiled code into a WAR file located in the `target` directory.

## Running the Application

After building the project, you can deploy the generated WAR file to a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat. Place the WAR file in the `webapps` directory of your Tomcat installation and start the server.

## Testing

The project includes unit tests for the application. You can run the tests using the following command:

```
mvn test
```

This will execute all tests defined in the `src/test` directory.

## Dependencies

The project dependencies are managed in the `pom.xml` file. You can add or update dependencies as needed for your application.
